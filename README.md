# Catch Sam Bankman-Fried Game

This Python script, utilizing the turtle library, creates a simple catching game where the player needs to click on randomly appearing images resembling Sam Bankman-Fried. The game runs in a 15x15 grid where the images randomly appear within the grid cells at intervals of 5 seconds.

## Features:
- Displays a grid-based environment where the images appear randomly.
- Tracks the player's score by counting successful clicks on the images.
- Implements a countdown timer of 30 seconds for gameplay.
- Notifies the player when the game ends and displays the final score.

The game is initiated by calling the function `start_game_up()`, which sets up the grid, initializes the score display, and begins the game loop by showing the images randomly and starting the countdown timer.

**Note:** This code could be further enhanced by optimizing the grid layout, adding additional game elements or challenges, and improving user interaction or interface feedback.
